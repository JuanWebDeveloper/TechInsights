### **Getting Started**

#### **1. Clone the Repository**

To begin, clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JuanWebDeveloper/TechInsights.git
cd TechInsights
```

#### **2. Setting Up the Virtual Environment**

Itâ€™s recommended to use a virtual environment for Python projects to manage dependencies effectively. Follow these steps:

1. **Create the Virtual Environment**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

2. **Activate the Virtual Environment**

   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS/Linux:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

3. **Install Required Dependencies**  
   Install the dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

#### **3. Configuring the Database**

Before running the project, you need to set up the database. TechInsights uses SQLite by default, but it can be configured for other databases.

1. **Apply Migrations**  
   Run the following commands to create the database and apply necessary migrations:

   ```bash
   python manage.py makemigrations
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

2. **Create a Superuser**  
   A superuser is required to manage categories and other administrative tasks. Create one using:

   ```bash
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

   Follow the prompts to set a username, email, and password.

3. **Manage Article Categories**
   - Article categories can only be created by the superuser.
   - Log in to the admin panel at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/` to create and manage categories.

---

#### **4. Running the Development Server**

To start the application, run the development server:

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

Access the site at [http://127.0.0.1:8000/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/).

#### **5. Additional Notes**

- Keep your `SECRET_KEY` secure in production environments.
